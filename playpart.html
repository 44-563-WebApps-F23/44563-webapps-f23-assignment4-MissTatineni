        <h5>NORA.</h5>
        <p>Good day, Doctor Rank. I knew your ring. But you mustn’t go in to
        Torvald now; I think he is busy with something.</p>
        
        <h5>RANK.</h5>
        <p>And you?</p>
        
        <h5>NORA.</h5>
        <p>_[brings him in and shuts the door after him]_.</p>
        <p>Oh, you know very well , I always have time for you.</p>
        
        <h5>RANK.</h5>
        <p>Thank you. I shall make use of as much of it as I can.</p>
        
        <h5>NORA.</h5>
        <p>What do you mean by that? As much of it as you can?</p>
        
        <h5>RANK.</h5>
        <p>Well, does that alarm you?</p>
        
        <h5>NORA.</h5>
        <p>It was such a strange way of putting it. Is anything likely to happen?</p>
        
        <h5>RANK.</h5>
        <p>Nothing but what I have long been prepared for. But I certainly didn’t
        expect it to happen so soon.</p>
        
        <h5>NORA.</h5>
        <p>_[gripping him by the arm]_.</p>
        <p>What have you found out? Doctor Rank, you must tell me.</p>
        
        <h5>RANK.</h5>
        <p>_[sitting down by the stove]_.</p>
        <p>It is all up with me. And it can’t be helped.</p>
        
        <h5>NORA.</h5>
        <p>_[with a sigh of relief]_.</p>
        <p>Is it about yourself?</p>
        
        <h5>RANK.</h5>
        <p>Who else? It is no use lying to one’s self. I am the most wretched of
        all my patients, Mrs Helmer. Lately I have been taking stock of my
        internal economy. Bankrupt! Probably within a month I shall lie rotting
        in the churchyard.</p>
        
        <h5>NORA.</h5>
        <p>What an ugly thing to say!</p>
        
        <h5>RANK.</h5>
        <p>The thing itself is cursedly ugly, and the worst of it is that I shall
        have to face so much more that is ugly before that. I shall only make
        one more examination of myself; when I have done that, I shall know
        pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will
        begin. There is something I want to tell you. Helmer’s refined nature
        gives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is ugly; I won’t
        have him in my sick-room.</p>
        
        <h5>NORA.</h5>
        <p>Oh, but, Doctor Rank—</p>
        
        <h5>RANK.</h5>
        <p>I won’t have him there. Not on any account. I bar my door to him. As
        soon as I am quite certain that the worst has come, I shall send you my
        card with a black cross on it, and then you will know that the
        loathsome end has begun.</p>
        
        <h5>NORA.</h5>
        <p>You are quite absurd today. And I wanted you so much to be in a really
        good humour.</p>
