        <b>NORA.</b>
        Good day, Doctor Rank. I knew your ring. But you mustn’t go in to
        Torvald now; I think he is busy with something.
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        And you?
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        <span style="color : blue;">_[brings him in and shuts the door after him]_.</span>
        Oh, you know very well , I always have time for you.
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        Thank you. I shall make use of as much of it as I can.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        What do you mean by that? As much of it as you can?
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        Well, does that alarm you?
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        It was such a strange way of putting it. Is anything likely to happen?
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        Nothing but what I have long been prepared for. But I certainly didn’t
        expect it to happen so soon.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        <span style="color : blue;">_[gripping him by the arm]_.</span>
         What have you found out? Doctor Rank, you must tell me.
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        <span style="color : blue;">_[sitting down by the stove]_.</span> 
        It is all up with me. And it can’t be helped.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        <span style="color : blue;"> _[with a sigh of relief]_.</span>
         Is it about yourself?
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        Who else? It is no use lying to one’s self. I am the most wretched of
        all my patients, Mrs Helmer. Lately I have been taking stock of my
        internal economy. Bankrupt! Probably within a month I shall lie rotting
        in the churchyard.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        What an ugly thing to say!
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        The thing itself is cursedly ugly, and the worst of it is that I shall
        have to face so much more that is ugly before that. I shall only make
        one more examination of myself; when I have done that, I shall know
        pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will
        begin. There is something I want to tell you. Helmer’s refined nature
        gives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is ugly; I won’t
        have him in my sick-room.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        Oh, but, Doctor Rank—
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        I won’t have him there. Not on any account. I bar my door to him. As
        soon as I am quite certain that the worst has come, I shall send you my
        card with a black cross on it, and then you will know that the
        loathsome end has begun.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        You are quite absurd today. And I wanted you so much to be in a really
        good humour.
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        With death stalking beside me?—To have to pay this penalty for another
        man’s sin? Is there any justice in that? And in every single family, in
        one way or another, some such inexorable retribution is being exacted—
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        <span style="color : blue;">_[putting her hands over her ears]_.</span>
         Rubbish! Do talk of something cheerful.
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        Oh, it’s a mere laughing matter, the whole thing. My poor innocent
        spine has to suffer for my father’s youthful amusements.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        <span style="color : blue;">_[sitting at the table on the left]_.</span> 
        I suppose you mean that he was too partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras, don’t you?
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        Yes, and to truffles.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        Truffles, yes. And oysters too, I suppose?
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        Oysters, of course, that goes without saying.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        And heaps of port and champagne. It is sad that all these nice things
        should take their revenge on our bones.
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        Especially that they should revenge themselves on the unlucky bones of
        those who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying them.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        Yes, that’s the saddest part of it all.
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        <span style="color : blue;">_[with a searching look at her]_. </span>
         Hm!—
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        <span style="color : blue;">_[after a short pause]_.</span> 
        Why did you smile?
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        No, it was you that laughed.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        No, it was you that smiled, Doctor Rank!
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        <span style="color : blue;">_[rising]_. </span>
        You are a greater rascal than I thought.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        I am in a silly mood today.
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        So it seems.
        
        <b>NORA.</b>
        <span style="color : blue;">_[putting her hands on his shoulders]_. </span> 
        dear Doctor Rank, death mustn’t take you away from Torvald and me.
        
        <b>RANK.</b>
        It is a loss you would easily recover from. <i>Those who are gone are soon
        forgotten.</i>
