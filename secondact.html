        <p class ="speech">With death stalking beside me?—To have to pay this penalty for another
        man’s sin? Is there any justice in that? And in every single family, in
        one way or another, some such inexorable retribution is being exacted</p>

        <h5 class="nora">NORA.</h5>
        <p class = "direction">_[putting her hands over her ears]_.</p> 
        <p class="speech">Rubbish! Do talk of something
        cheerful.</p>

        <h5 class="rank">RANK.</h5>
        <p class="speech">Oh, it’s a mere laughing matter, the whole thing. My poor innocent

        <h5 class="rank">RANK.</h5>
        <p class="speech">Oysters, of course, that goes without saying.</p>

        <h5 class="nora">NORA.</h5>
        <p class="speech">And heaps of port and champagne. It is sad that all these nice things
        should take their revenge on our bones.</p>

        <h5 class="rank">RANK.</h5>
        <p class="speech">Especially that they should revenge themselves on the unlucky bones of
        those who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying them.</p>

        <h5 class="nora">NORA.</h5>
        <p class="speech">Yes, that’s the saddest part of it all.</p>
